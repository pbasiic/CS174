                        Sophia Singh was born September 6, 2002 in Dallas, Texas. She was born a child prodigy who had an innate skill for reading people's minds and emotions. Her powers quickly developed from a young age as she was trained by her mentor, Master Yoda. She eventually became the Yoda's smartest student with unmatched telepathic skills. During her training with Yoda, she met Luke Skywalker and they banded forces. Together, the two were unstoppable and quickly became Yoda's most gifted students. Skywalker vowed to protect Sophia from any harm and promised he would arrive if she ever were in trouble. Long after their training, Skywalker has kept true to that promise by saving Sophia from the vicious evils of sorority girls.
